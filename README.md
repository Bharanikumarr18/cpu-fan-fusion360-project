# 💻 Design and Fabrication of CPU Fan and Case using Fusion 360

**Mini Project by Bharanikumar Arunagiri**

This mini project involved designing and 3D printing a custom CPU fan and protective case using Autodesk Fusion 360. The primary goal was to develop a compact, thermally efficient design suitable for personal computing devices. The model was sliced in Ultimaker Cura and fabricated using FDM 3D printing. Although the model was not motor-tested, the project demonstrates skills in CAD design, 3D printing preparation, and physical prototyping.
